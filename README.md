MMFE
====

A murder mystery for everyone!

MMFE is an attempt at a cooperative murder mystery presented as a visual novel.
Each player takes control of a character in a mansion where a murder has occurred
and no one can leave until the murderer is found.

Players participate in dialogues as visual novel characters and are presented choices
at different intervals. Conversation flow is ultimately directed by the individual players,
however dialogue options are generated dynamically by the game.
